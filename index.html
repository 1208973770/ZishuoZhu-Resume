        <p class="lead mb-4">Digging into my deepest memory, I don’t remember my mother being there for me. It was years later that I was informed by my father that my mom had gone to the US to shape a better life for my family; while my father worked perpetually to support my family income in China. Therefore, my dad couldn’t take care of me well enough, so I was sent to my grandparents’ house for better care. At my grandparents’ place, I was taken care of, but my life was dull, it was class all day, and countless hours of homework at night. I was alone, I had no one to express my feelings to, so I was forced to grow mature at an early age.
Two years later, I was reunited with my mom in the US along with my dad. My parents were busy due to work, they only provided me with basic needs. So I looked forward to meeting new friends at my new school, but I faced the cruel reality. My amateur English received no attention, and I was alone once again. But as time went on, I learned to entertain myself with books. For a period of time, I lived in books, where everything was fascinating. But as I learned to adapt as an independent teenager. I cooked and studied by myself, my parents also depended on me, from phone calls to filing documents. From elementary, I’ve experienced the most lonely aspect of life, but I stood up instead of giving up. I believe there’s no obstacle that can block my path to a successful life.

I couldn’t contact my teachers when I had questions due to the lack of technology; so I learned to self-study at home and take useful notes in class. From that point on, I would study by myself every night, it taught me how to be independent, to not rely on anyone but my 10-year-old self.
	After two years, my family reunited in the U.S. because my mother had applied for immigration for me and my father. I was happy when I heard the news, but things weren’t much different in the U.S. My father and mother worked restlessly to keep our lives normal; I, on the other hand, learned to speak English with my tutor. For that reason, my parents bought piles of frozen food, because it was cheap and easy. It was delicious at first but after weeks of eating it, the food becomes tasteless. I haven’t had a quality cooked meal for a long time, so when my parents came home from work, I asked them to cook food, but they rejected me.
	“If you want to eat so much, do it yourself!” shouted my mother in Chinese.
	“Do it yourself”, these words sink into my brain. After that, my parents became a source of income to me, I never asked my parents for anything else. I would do everything myself because I’ve realized that I live for myself, not for anyone else. I’ve become more independent than any other child of my age, at school, I would pour my heart out to my closest friends, and at home, I would study by myself.

<br><br>

        As a 10-year-old kid, I’ve never traveled outside of mainland China. So when my family decided to immigrate to the U.S., I knew a shift in my life was unavoidable. The first thing that I sensed at the LAX was the taste of fresh air; then, it was the chattering of a language that I couldn’t comprehend. With the radio blasting words that I couldn’t understand, strangers speaking in an unusual tongue,  I felt I was in a brand new world. It had come to my realization that in this foreign land, the first thing I must accomplish is to be familiar with its language.
	During my first year of school, I was alone, my grades were a disaster due to my lack of English. Hence, I enrolled in an English learning class outside of school. There, I constantly practiced my English skills, thus, my hearing and speaking skills became more proficient; I could translate more words in my mind. I attended the class every day, and when I was at home, I would recite the words I’ve acquired in class until they’re prisoned in my brain. When it was time for summer break, other kids hung out with each other and I memorized English words inside a classroom.
After three years of ceaseless English learning, I could finally communicate and read like others. As a result, my grades increased dramatically, it also allowed me to socialize and build a social circle around me; I had experienced hell and escaped it. If my hardships had taught me one thing, it would be to know my desires, to have a motivation no matter the circumstances. My yearning for grades and friends guided me through the toughest three years of my life, they gave me the thirst for a new life.

        Fresh coffee for the morning, gym time, conferences, a personal business, these events in the movies structured my childhood dream. As I grew, I discovered that our modern society is constituted based on the economy of the people and their desire for luxuriousness. My parents would constantly tell me that to be able to succeed, I must be familiarized with the system of numbers. This knowledge advanced from my childhood to adolescence, it sunk deep into my brain.
Ever since my childhood, I’ve been fascinated by the subject of mathematics. I was intrigued by the complex interplay between mathematics and the logic behind it; it caused me to develop a fetish for math. This passion for mathematics led me to take advanced courses in high school, such as Honors Pre-calculus, AP Calculus, and AP Economics. The concept of problem-solving is essential in these courses, but the lesson of logic was the essence in these classes. I slowly grew accustomed to the math problems, I thirsted for more critical problem-solving; that’s when I began to chase my dreams.
I started gathering information about building a small online business. My interest in the clothing department guided me to re-sell limited edition clothes. It required me to search the market, to collect the original price of the clothes, with its predicted resell value. Since the price tags of the clothing market aren’t steady, I also had to calculate the profit I can gain from it. But a question arose—which day do I sell, and when can I make the most profit? The most prominent factor to solve this obstacle is the customers, their bids on the market will decide which day will be the most profitable. I watched the market carefully, and I was able to catch the precise moment when the bid was high and made my first bucket of gold. A sense of success rushed through my veins, my blood pumped in cheer, and it left me with an ambitious heart. In the near future, I hope to turn my ambition into reality with the help of the University of California.
As the roasting summer kicked in, I and my companions at summer school were exhausted, we craved some fresh air outside of our house and classroom; we planned to go out. But a question arose: where? The struggle to decide left us under the scorching sun for eternity. Suddenly, a hoarse voice popped all of us, it was after seconds that I had realized it was my voice. I had asked my group what their hobby was, then I analyzed each specific hobby and suggested my answer. The reaction was immediate, agreement spread around my group. I was engaged with joy and a sense of accomplishment, for it was the first time I’ve led a group with my own voice; and it’s addicting.
As time progressed to 2020, Covid-19 struck the US, and we’re imprisoned at our own house. Luckily, classes and clubs were able to continue through zoom meetings. I attended a statistic club since I was not able to enroll in the actual course, hoping to scrape up some knowledge. But when I went to the meeting, it shocked me, hardly anyone except the cabinet members showed up to the first club meeting. Then the second meeting repeated the first, so I made my first move, inviting the cabinet members for a zoom meeting. At the meeting, I advocated for a club competition that will reward the participants, this way, the club meeting will be more compelling, of course, they agreed. We started preparing right away, as the planner of the event, I distributed jobs to the cabinet members. I requested the club president to plan the theme of the competition and to buy prizes like gift cards or other things we can dispatch digitally. Then, I contacted every friend of mine and informed them about the event, and asked them to spread the news of the competition around. 
	During the third meeting, the number of participants increased substantially. The competition was exciting, and everyone shared their laughs miles away from each other. When it ended, my heart pounded with excitement just like on that hot summer day.
